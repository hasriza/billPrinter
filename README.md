# billPrinter
A simple React Native application that acts as an interface between TM P20 Printer for Android.

This application was developed to help a client print KOTs from the web application. 
Since, window's print function does not process print operation in mobile devices, this application ran as a background service that allowed printing of the bills passed through application URL with data.
